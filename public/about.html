          <h3>Rexba</h3>
            <p>Raiding will always be some of my favorite memories. No matter which phase or raid there was ALWAYS something going on. I think some of my favorite raid memories starts with if you knew there was any sort of gauntlet style area whether it be AQ, BWL or even Naxx, you knew <b>Sketch</b> was going to crash out because of a totem pulling mobs, we even got to the point where we are pulling bosses with rogue totems.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another favorite memory was you just knew who was going to be playing floor PoV half the raid and they would always swear they were never in anything, but it never was not funny when it happened.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I would probably say my favorite phase would be between phase 4, phase 1 and phase 8.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Phase 1 was definitely a wild ride. It was the 1st time something like this was done in WoW especially in a classic environment. The mystery of what runes we would be getting, how we would get them, the new level 25 EPICS (though that staff still avoids me to this day), the amazing open world PvP in Ashenvale. Phase 1 had it all, even BFD was great. The raid was smaller with only 10 people so it felt more personable in a sense. Though we attempted to always mix up groups, there were certain people I just always looked forward to playing with as they were just amazing people to be around.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Phase 4, we finally got to level 60 and the journey to prebis began. We constantly had tons of dungeon groups going trying to go for the .5 quest chain. We were setting up groups for silithus to get people their pre-bis, doing all these things just to get us prepared for what was at the time, the 1st raid that had different difficulties which was suuuper exciting at the time to be able to work through, even though Heat level 3 was by far the easiest of them all lol.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Phase 8 might edge it out just a little for me because we got the brand new raid. Not only was it original content but it was challenging content. It was sooo much fun to finally be able to truly progress through a raid with the people I have not just enjoyed playing with but being around in general. It was fun to see how we progressed with hitting some speed bumps and talking through it as a guild in terms of strategy and what works best for us.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One of the best memories was Caldoran. From our 1st pulls of struggling with fire positioning to coming in the next week with all of Thursday available for progression. We had strong prog throughout the night and it was such an amazing feeling seeing the bosses health drop lower with each pull as we cleaned things up. Getting to Phase 2 the 1st time, you could feel it that everyone knew we were so close to the kill. Wiping on Ashbringer in Phase 2 at 1%, you just knew everyone was fully locked in and it was insane to see that happen. Until next pull happened and <b>Shears'</b> internet decided it was too excited as well and DC'd him which forced us to run into fire to make sure he could get the guilds 1st Ashbringer.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Jas</b> logging in right before the last pull just felt like it was meant to be since he had been with us since Phase 3 and became such a pillar of the guild.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Seeing Caldoran fall over and everyone just let out cheers, it was probably the most rewarding feeling I have had in SoD, and the fact that we were able to get this done before the raid buff came in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I came into SoD with the intention of just sitting back and just playing the game without really any responsibility, but boy did that change almost immediately. <span class="editor-note">Editor's Note: lol</span> Sketch came to me about co-leading a guild with him and I just couldn't say no.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Co-leading the guild has definitely come with some difficulties. Not many (if any) know about the amount of drama there was behind the scenes at times. We definitely have some "Regret Lore" that we will touch on later <i>(small hint)</i>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Even with all the drama, totem pulling, loot drama and a marriage almost breaking up (or maybe it did) I would do it all over again. I was glad to be able to do it with <b>Sketch.</b> We have spent countless hours at work and at home brainstorming ideas how to make the guild as transparent and fair as we could while also making sure it was as fun for everyone involved and I think we did almost as good of a job as we could.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Most of all though, we have met some pretty great people starting all the way in Phase 1 with the OGs that are still left standing <b>Aloki, Fullofowls, Jujaba, Ashketchum, Skeezelord(aka instagib), Surtain, Turboblastin</b> and everyone in-between and up to Phase 8. Every raid night is always something I still look forward to and get excited for.</p>

          <h3>Fullofowls</h3>
            <p>It's been a fun ride with Regret. I really appreciate <b>Sketchit</b> and <b>Rexba</b> taking on the leadership burden and letting slackers like me have a wonderful place to chill each week. I think it's like after you have a bad headache and afterward you are like wow I don't appreciate enough days where I feel great. Looking back on not only you two but the rest of the motley crew, its easy to take for granted what a great group this is, even if 1 or 2 furries snuck in.</p>
            <br>  
            <p>Remember when we had 4 (or more) raid groups in BFD and Group 3 led by <b>Prime</b> threatened to rebel because loot took almost an hour? That was hilarious...</p>
            <br>
            <p>My favorite memory of SOD will be when we were still on the Living Flame PVP server and it was a pretty one-sided affair; the alliance outnumbered us by a mile and world-pvp was a constant thorn. During phase 1 one day about 10 of us gathered together and camped the pool on the way to the BFD entrance. Body after unsuspecting body dropped from above to their doom as we slaughtered alliance chars for over an hour. Obv it didn't make up for the rest of the time there, however :)</p>
            <br>  
            <p>Thanks to everyone!</p>

        <h3>Turboblast</h3>
        <p>Some of my favorite memories with <b>&lt;Regret&gt;</b> were the no life leveling groups at the beginning of each phase as well as just the overall hype of everyone being online when a new phase started. It was incredible to get the chance to no life with some of my friends whom I haven't gotten to play much with in the last 10 years. We used to just play games nonstop.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have been touching grass the last few years and I am so excited for the timeskip arc to begin. Shout out to my besties: <b>Ashketchum, Sketch, and Rexba</b>, as well as my former best friend: <b>Stardragon (M.I.A)</b>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of my favorite phases was Gnomeregan. New raid fights were so fun to experience together and beating the last bosses of new raids was so fulfilling. It was fun trying to beat the other raid group and see who could clear first.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Phase 1 was also just amazing. I missed the first raid clear of BFD (my biggest <b>&lt;regret&gt;</b>) but I was grateful my friends let me nepo baby along with the alt raids and then the main raids at the end of the phase. Obviously some of the most memorable single moments have to be the Hero of Azeroth defeating KT and the first kill of Caldoran.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks to <b>Sketch</b> for leading the guild and <b>Rexba</b> for leading a bunch of noobs and for putting up with me being late. I flaked out when we did Classic TBC and that's probably my second biggest <b>&lt;regret&gt;</b>. Thanks to everyone in the guild for being overall just so much fun to play with. I haven't raided with a dedicated raid team in years and it felt so good.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Overall SoD was amazing, I hope there is more content going forward. I'll try and be less <b>&lt;antisocial&gt;</b> going forward. Throwback. <span class="editor-note">Editor's Note: Antisocial was the name of the guild I ran during TBC Classic. I lasted until Gruul's Lair. :D</span> I still think about Rexba explaining raid mechanics gently in my ear every night before I go to bed.</p>

        <li>stv event was a ton of fun, regret smashed it and back then the guild was very active.</li>
        <li>favorite raid was definitely AQ, everyone was excited to progress and farm it despite never seeing weapon drops</li>
        <li>tanks Hoo keep forgetting to change their runes (seemed to happen a lot in BWL)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>also I'd like to add my favorite thing:</p>
      <p>how you (<b>Sketchit</b>) and <b>rex</b> deal with all the drama we've had and how it somehow never managed to impact the guild<br>
      i love the <span style="color:#ffd700; font-family:'LifeCraft',serif; text-shadow:1px 1px 2px #000;">"if you don't like it, fuck off"</span> attitude—it made the guild solid.</p>

      <li>Random banter in disc during raids (the game is 20 at this point) theres nothing (besides Scarlet Enclave) that no one hasnt done before it's the people and the camaraderie that keeps people playing long term</li>
      <li>Finally getting High Warlord at least once before I die</li>
      <li>Getting a 100 parse on KT but only because I had 4 piece and MoM week 2 before other shamans geared up</li>

      Best Phase would be 7 for me eventhough I dont like Naxx too much

    <p><b>Phase 8 - SE:</b> By far my favorite raid. Swapping to feral has been a BLAST and the jokes have been at an all time high. Always a great time.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Phase 7 - Naxx / Kara:</b> Coming back and feeling welcomed like I never left. The help I received to catch back up was amazing. Finding a home Mk.II</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Phase 6 - AQ:</b> Still being G-kicked by association <span class="editor-note">Editor's Note: Oops Part 2</span></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Phase 5 - ZG &amp; BWL:</b> Being G-kicked by association <span class="editor-note">Editor's Note: Oops</span></p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Phase 4 - MC:</b> First real challenge as a group. Farming FR gear was fun and the teamwork was at an all time high.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Phase 3 - Sunken Temple:</b> The Greedy Saga was one for the ages.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Phase 2 - Gnomeregan / Blood Moon:</b> Swapping from DPS to tank and really finding a home for SoD</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Phase 1 - BFD:</b> N/A</p>
