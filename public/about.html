          <h3>Rexba</h3>
            <p>Raiding will always be some of my favorite memories. No matter which phase or raid there was ALWAYS something going on. I think some of my favorite raid memories starts with if you knew there was any sort of gauntlet style area whether it be AQ, BWL or even Naxx, you knew <b>Sketch</b> was going to crash out because of a totem pulling mobs, we even got to the point where we are pulling bosses with rogue totems.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Another favorite memory was you just knew who was going to be playing floor PoV half the raid and they would always swear they were never in anything, but it never was not funny when it happened.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I would probably say my favorite phase would be between phase 4, phase 1 and phase 8.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Phase 1 was definitely a wild ride. It was the 1st time something like this was done in WoW especially in a classic environment. The mystery of what runes we would be getting, how we would get them, the new level 25 EPICS (though that staff still avoids me to this day), the amazing open world PvP in Ashenvale. Phase 1 had it all, even BFD was great. The raid was smaller with only 10 people so it felt more personable in a sense. Though we attempted to always mix up groups, there were certain people I just always looked forward to playing with as they were just amazing people to be around.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Phase 4, we finally got to level 60 and the journey to prebis began. We constantly had tons of dungeon groups going trying to go for the .5 quest chain. We were setting up groups for silithus to get people their pre-bis, doing all these things just to get us prepared for what was at the time, the 1st raid that had different difficulties which was suuuper exciting at the time to be able to work through, even though Heat level 3 was by far the easiest of them all lol.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Phase 8 might edge it out just a little for me because we got the brand new raid. Not only was it original content but it was challenging content. It was sooo much fun to finally be able to truly progress through a raid with the people I have not just enjoyed playing with but being around in general. It was fun to see how we progressed with hitting some speed bumps and talking through it as a guild in terms of strategy and what works best for us.</p>
            <br>
            <p>One of the best memories was Caldoran. From our 1st pulls of struggling with fire positioning to coming in the next week with all of Thursday available for progression. We had strong prog throughout the night and it was such an amazing feeling seeing the bosses health drop lower with each pull as we cleaned things up. Getting to Phase 2 the 1st time, you could feel it that everyone knew we were so close to the kill. Wiping on Ashbringer in Phase 2 at 1%, you just knew everyone was fully locked in and it was insane to see that happen. Until next pull happened and <b>Shears'</b> internet decided it was too excited as well and DC'd him which forced us to run into fire to make sure he could get the guilds 1st Ashbringer.</p>
            <br>
            <p><b>Jas</b> logging in right before the last pull just felt like it was meant to be since he had been with us since Phase 3 and became such a pillar of the guild.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Seeing Caldoran fall over and everyone just let out cheers, it was probably the most rewarding feeling I have had in SoD, and the fact that we were able to get this done before the raid buff came in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I came into SoD with the intention of just sitting back and just playing the game without really any responsibility, but boy did that change almost immediately. <span class="editor-note">Editor's Note: lol</span> Sketch came to me about co-leading a guild with him and I just couldn't say no.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Co-leading the guild has definitely come with some difficulties. Not many (if any) know about the amount of drama there was behind the scenes at times. We definitely have some "Regret Lore" that we will touch on later <i>(small hint)</i>.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Even with all the drama, totem pulling, loot drama and a marriage almost breaking up (or maybe it did) I would do it all over again. I was glad to be able to do it with <b>Sketch.</b> We have spent countless hours at work and at home brainstorming ideas how to make the guild as transparent and fair as we could while also making sure it was as fun for everyone involved and I think we did almost as good of a job as we could.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Most of all though, we have met some pretty great people starting all the way in Phase 1 with the OGs that are still left standing <b>Aloki, Fullofowls, Jujaba, Ashketchum, Skeezelord(aka instagib), Surtain, Turboblastin</b> and everyone in-between and up to Phase 8. Every raid night is always something I still look forward to and get excited for.</p>

          <h3>Fullofowls</h3>
            <p>It's been a fun ride with Regret. I really appreciate <b>Sketchit</b> and <b>Rexba</b> taking on the leadership burden and letting slackers like me have a wonderful place to chill each week. I think it's like after you have a bad headache and afterward you are like wow I don't appreciate enough days where I feel great. Looking back on not only you two but the rest of the motley crew, its easy to take for granted what a great group this is, even if 1 or 2 furries snuck in.</p>
            <br>  
            <p>Remember when we had 4 (or more) raid groups in BFD and Group 3 led by <b>Prime</b> threatened to rebel because loot took almost an hour? That was hilarious...</p>
            <br>
            <p>My favorite memory of SOD will be when we were still on the Living Flame PVP server and it was a pretty one-sided affair; the alliance outnumbered us by a mile and world-pvp was a constant thorn. During phase 1 one day about 10 of us gathered together and camped the pool on the way to the BFD entrance. Body after unsuspecting body dropped from above to their doom as we slaughtered alliance chars for over an hour. Obv it didn't make up for the rest of the time there, however :)</p>
            <br>  
            <p>Thanks to everyone!</p>

        <h3>Turboblast</h3>
        <p>Some of my favorite memories with <b>&lt;Regret&gt;</b> were the no life leveling groups at the beginning of each phase as well as just the overall hype of everyone being online when a new phase started. It was incredible to get the chance to no life with some of my friends whom I haven't gotten to play much with in the last 10 years. We used to just play games nonstop.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I have been touching grass the last few years and I am so excited for the timeskip arc to begin. Shout out to my besties: <b>Ashketchum, Sketch, and Rexba</b>, as well as my former best friend: <b>Stardragon (M.I.A)</b>.</p>
        <br>
        <p>One of my favorite phases was Gnomeregan. New raid fights were so fun to experience together and beating the last bosses of new raids was so fulfilling. It was fun trying to beat the other raid group and see who could clear first.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Phase 1 was also just amazing. I missed the first raid clear of BFD (my biggest <b>&lt;regret&gt;</b>) but I was grateful my friends let me nepo baby along with the alt raids and then the main raids at the end of the phase. Obviously some of the most memorable single moments have to be the Hero of Azeroth defeating KT and the first kill of Caldoran.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Thanks to <b>Sketch</b> for leading the guild and <b>Rexba</b> for leading a bunch of noobs and for putting up with me being late. I flaked out when we did Classic TBC and that's probably my second biggest <b>&lt;regret&gt;</b>. Thanks to everyone in the guild for being overall just so much fun to play with.

        <p>While every phase that I've gotten to play with you fine folks has been a blast, it's definitely a tie between P6 and P8. P6 for the fact that when I last played WoW in Classic, my guild was never able to clear C'thun, which basically resulted in the guild disbanding. Loot Council, Guild Leader rage, and general lack of progress led to some really harsh vibes, and a group that I was beginning to become somewhat comfortable in suddenly just stopped having fun. I have never felt that in &lt;Regret&gt;, as we still always find a way to make things fun, even if we are hitting a wall in progress (which never lasts more than a week, haha). I've been an on-and-off player since Vanilla, but despite having less free time than ever as I get older, I always try to carve out what time I can for the folks here, because I genuinely enjoy the peeps, the attitudes, and of course the laughs.</p>
        <br>
        <p>P8 has been a blast too, with new gear, plenty of new challenges, and it's extremely fun to figure out the new strategies together and perfect them. I'd consider everyone here a friend, because even if distance separates us, the totems will always pull us (and bosses) together ❤</p>

        <h3>Ashketchum</h3>
        <p>Season of Discovery is one of those rare sparks that remind me of how powerful the medium of video games can be sometimes. It was the first time in a very long time that I was genuinely excited to play World of Warcraft again, a feeling I don’t think I’ve really had since Burning Crusade. Funnily enough, for me, one of my favorite times playing WoW in vanilla was actually after I had left <b>Star</b> and <b>Sketchit</b> and server transferred, where I got more into world PvP and light raiding. I was excited to be able to finally share that experience with my old friends whom I’ve since played so many games with. You’ll of course imagine my shock when half of them didn’t show up and <b>Star</b> left a bit after turning 60. Fortunately for me, at least, <b>Rexba</b> was more than willing to try and fill the holes that they left, like he is with so many others. While we started the season off on a bad foot by picking a bad guild name when a perfect one was presented right in front of us, I think Sketchit was able to recover and craft what I think was a beautiful guild experience for the duration of this season. It is also good that nobody in the guild would remain bitter over the name for the entirety of the season.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Picking a favorite phase of SoD for me isn’t particularly hard at all, it’s phase 1 by a landslide. Part of this is because of my love of seeing the potential in something while it is new, letting me daydream and explore in my head how new systems will play out and evolve over time. This feeling was abundant in phase 1, runes were such a cool new system that breathed life back into the dated combat of classic WoW, and they left plenty of room for us to speculate on what runes we would get in the future and how that would tweak our builds. The long and arduous quests needed for some of these runs were fun too, it was cool to watch Warlocks have to do what felt like a legendary item quest chain just to unlock the cornerstone of their new tank build they were promised for SoD. The mystery of not knowing exactly where to find the new runes was fun, too. I still regret losing patience and looking up the Beast Mastery rune unlock in Eastern Kingdoms when I would have just naturally stumbled upon the way to unlock it in Kalimdor if I had just continued questing.  It brought that feeling of community back to WoW that so many people agree has long since faded from the retail version of the game. People were sharing locations of NPCs needed for runes, forming groups to go hunt down runes that, for some reason, were locked in Alliance starting zones.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Which leads into the second main reason that phase 1 was my favorite phase; it was the only phase where we spent the entirety of it on a PvP server.<span class="editor-note">Editor's Note: We didn't transfer off Living Flame until the end of Phase 3, my cousin is a goober.</span> World PvP was something that I have always felt was done really well in vanilla WoW. It was the perfect storm of a world that felt very connected while still requiring a decent amount of time and effort to traverse. This is the perfect world to have that sense of danger added by the threat of other players able to kill you and cost you time. It takes something as simple as grinding turtles as Aman’thul intended, and turns it into a lesson in tension and risk management. Do I kite several turtles at once to save time and optimize my ammo usage with multi-shot, or does that leave me too open to getting ganked alone? Is this place too popular for me to farm alone, or should I find a lesser-known and more secluded spot to farm? Is my getting camped urgent enough to call friends for help, or should I just take a break or hearth to go elsewhere? Well, that last one is a trick; retribution always takes priority, but it’s nice to at least consider it. The moment we left for a PvE server, that tension was gone. And with it went my sense of engagement and immersion in the world. Sure, we could now get into Gnomer and other dungeons unmolested. But was it worth it to shave away a crucial part of the game's soul?</p>
        <br>
        <p>But I digress, because truthfully, I feel both of these reasons are actually eclipsed by the final aspect of phase 1 that made it my favorite: the creativity that the framing of it forced on the players and the devs. This was a phase that capped at level 25. With no mounts, not even half of our kits, and access to only level 150 crafting, we were expected to complete a raid while also engaging in the best World PvP event they’ve ever put into the game. This forced a wholly creative experience on the player base. Remember those small shadow protection pots you probably just vendored in vanilla WoW while leveling alchemy? These are now a premium, high-end consumable, and no, I don’t think you have the credit score to afford what this did to the price of grave moss. Mana potions were essential for this phase, but they were also entirely uncraftable, so sneaking into Desolace to fish for lockboxes to loot them became a legit gold farm. Bottlenecking all the late-game activity to Ashenvale was also a beautiful move. The zone was already tricky to navigate with an Alliance town right in the middle of the zone, while the Horde controls the edges, which made the world PvP feel mostly organic, and lorewise, this fit the feel of the zone.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now, don’t get me wrong, I had a lot of fun in the following phases, and the community that we built made for some of the best times I’ve ever had in World of Warcraft. From lifeguarding the entrance to BFD to seeing who could piss off grumpy the most with Gift of Gob, I have loved sharing this season with all of you. And while I could never pick favorites outside of <b>Vuhduh</b>, I want you all to know you are the best WoW players I’ve ever had the pleasure of playing with. </p>

          Favorite phase probably phase 1 with the initial leveling rush and all the friends, the 10 layers on the server constantly with tons of people. Started out with all of my friends who I cleared TBC classic with through the last boss of Sunwell and it was good times. People here met one of them briefly twice in the priest Photon. This guild alas died in early phase 3, my main tank through Sunwell did one daily run of incursions at level 43 and said wtf is this shit and promptly logged off, he still hasnt re-subbed to this day. Most of the rest of my original guild never made it to level 50 that phase. But i persevered, tried to find a few places to raid ST, I was really hoping to see what the kara and scarlet content would be in the long term. Not too long after that Regret came over to Wild Growth and I found my new long term home.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Favorite raid phase has probably been Scarlet Enclave, I have been very pleased with how they made the raid given their small team. I find it very enjoyable and well done, plus its actually brand new. More than I expected with the low budget I am sure Blizzard is allocating to this project. Close 2nd place was the kara 5 man, incredible instance with lots of lore. Felt like the first truly classic + content.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Favorite Regret specific memory is joining this guild shortly after you xfered to wild growth (I have been on wild growth the whole time) and I saw how easily you cleared sunken temple while my old dead guild couldnt kill eranikus and it was such a breath of fresh air. And you weren't a bunch of assholes as a bonus!

          I joined Regret in Phase 4, after having been abandoned by all my buds who quit when our server got locked. I had a hard choice in that I could either stop playing SoD or try to find a group I could work with. What I found was a "Merry band of retards" who accepted me, helped me when I needed it, made me laugh, and let me find new friends.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I don't have a specific phase I loved more than any others, but I do have a favorite moment/memory. It was the day KC dropped. I logged in and got immediately shanghai'ed by <b>Jas</b> to get attuned so that we could run it. That first run was honestly one of the most fun times I have ever had in an MMO. Exploring the new dungeon with people who were kind, patient and happy to laugh at stupid situations as they happened was the moment I genuinely felt like I wasn't just a raid fill but part of the guild.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          From running Strath for gold with <b>Fyra, Shears</b> or <b>Jas</b>, learning to PVP on a priest with <b>Shears</b>, to trying and help whenever anyone asks, I wouldn't trade a moment of SoD, and fully plan to try and stick around with you guys for as long as we can find games to goof off with together.

          - Phase 7 and 8, During Naxx/Kara I was able to play more consistently and play in smaller groups with people trying to gear up, shooting the shit and getting know more people in guild outside of raid.

          I started hating the game from raiding so much from the start of Classic re-release through SoD Phase 3. Plus it didn't help playing with shit guilds and people. Playing with &lt;Regret&gt; during phase 8 has been awesome and being part of the guild is what has made it so great. Thank you for letting me come back to raid and be part of the team.

          I joined Regret towards the very end of Phase 6. I was new to WoW, playing with my WoW veteran buddy <b>Tectonictim</b> (M.I.A :(). We were leveling doing some SM spams when <b>Jas</b> joined us on his priest. Shortly we hit lockout cap and Jas invited us to Regret.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          I didn't really start raiding with the rest of the guild until a few weeks into Phase 7. As a new player I was nervous to join a guild raid without having a firm grasp on my class utility/rotation, as well as raid mechanics (Even MC/BWL/ZG were unknowns). After the first Naxx I joined, I quickly realized that isn't necessarily a requirement for this guild (Jokes).
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          As I started to attend raid on a regular basis I was blown away by how quickly everyone was willing to help me outside of raid with Kara runs, idol runs, etc.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Phase 8 has definitely been my favorite phase so far. The first week of Scarlet Enclave learning mechanics as a guild for the first time, while frustrating, was particularly enjoyable for me as a newish player. Collaborating with guildies, researching strats, and trial and error was a fresh experience compared to clearing a raid that had been solved for ~20 years. Jumping into SE with Regret has quickly made Tuesdays one of my favorite days of the week.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The first Caldoran kill was definitely my favorite memory to-date. Just a few weeks prior, we were struggling to 3/8 clear, and now we have got it down to a full 8/8 in one raid night. Despite the nerfs/adjustments that occurred, the early struggle made the final victory all that more rewarding.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Big thanks to <b>Sketch</b> and <b>Rexba</b> for managing this whole thing. I feel lucky that Regret has been my first guild experience and look forward to what comes next. Shoutout <b>Jas</b> for inviting some rando warrior to the guild. <span class="editor-note">Editor's Note: I'm really glad I didn't gkick the randos <b>Jasmiller</b> invited on a whim. ;)</span>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          And to my fellow Warriors <b>Shears</b> and <b>Sache</b>, it has been so fun competing with you guys on the meters and talking warrior shit outside of raid. Y'all have helped me improve tremendously and I am incredibly thankful.

          Some of my best World of Warcraft experiences have been with this guild, from day one i was welcomed and made to feel like part of the group.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Everyone helped me get where I am today as a filthy horde shaman and I've loved every moment of it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My favorite raid has been this tier because it feels like a culmination of all our hard work and ability to keep the retard pants off, through trial and error and mostly doing it blind without too many guides, this raid especially felt earned to me for us as a group.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My favorite memory of my time in the guild was when the guild made 2 raids to farm a stupid dungeon just to help me get a skill book that wasn't that big of a deal, not because I'm glad i got it but because it was what really told me everyone cared and i belonged here.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          This group of players truly feels like none before, everyone is there as a group and is heard and special to our identity in there own way, that's definitely not something you find often in life and i appreciate it. ❤️

          Phases 2, 5, and 7 were good ones.

        <br>
        <p>
          My best memories were of <b>Tivon</b> the shaman legend who single-handedly carried Gnomer raids while we chased parses with extremely undergeared alts.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Sunken Temple when the raid leader called out for 2 to stay out during dragons to wake everyone up and all the pumpers to go in the dream and do big damage. Nobody stayed out and we wiped lol, but big damage was done! Almost.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          ZG when we did a 20 man power raid with our all of our Gnomer groups even tho we were in like 5 different guilds at that time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Phase 7 when <b>Shears</b> got locked out of Maexxna and we still bust his balls about it every raid haha.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          And my favorite is our video of a completely smooth fail/win raid video from Phase 2. <b>Shears</b> friend made it and it really sums up SoD.

          The one when <b>Fenris</b> says all of us are perverts XD (when <b>Aloky</b> promise the photo of his wife...)<br>
          the moment per se was funny, but hear <b>Fenris</b> say that for me was even more funny adn also was the 1st thing we can hear after we kill the boss.<br>

I've never seen my guild lock in so quickly. We killed Sapph that next pull. We're perverts, I suppose.

          I was a late edition to the Regret family. I joined in phase 6 after taking a 15 year hiatus from Warcraft and most games in general. I got the itch to start playing and leveled to 60 mostly alone due to having the new account restrictions for 30 days after reinitiating my account. It was lonely. But when I hit 60 I started doing raids with pug groups and was kicked out of some because my gear wasn't up to snuff. I'm pretty sure I responded to a LFG add Rexba had put out and surprisingly the guild welcomed me when so many others had turned me away. You were well into AQ 40 and I was geared in greens. I remember getting crap from someone the first night as one of my trinkets was the DFC entry trinket and someone helped me save up for the Speedstone. I was fresh fresh and hadn't earned my epic mount gold yet but with the guild I got an AQ40 HM bug which made life in the game so much better.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          The guild was welcoming and friendly and while I didn't get all the inside jokes at first grew to love the degeneracy that we all exhibit. Raid nights were chill for the most part until we had the wrong pants on and had to get straightened out by <b>Sketch</b> but we managed to clear some great content, if not helped slightly by the <b>Hero of Azeroth</b> from time to time.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          Naxx was my favorite raid, as I never got to see inside it the first go around in Vanilla. I dreamt about wielding Ashbringer way back then and was excited to see it in raid, only to find out they had replaced it with Blade of Inquisition for that phase. The hype that we might finally get an epic questline to secure the purified version was so exciting. Until we found out about Scarlet Enclave I was content to hang with the gang and try my damndest to keep up with all my warrior buds, <b>Shears</b>, <b>Marz</b>, <b>Hayderz</b> and few others we lost along the way.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          My favorite moment of the game was just this evening. I struggled on Tuesday to complete the Ashbringer fight and after I ran out of consumes and hearths I packed it up for the night. My head wasn't in it and honestly it would have felt hollow with no one else on to share the experience with. Tonight I went back and again struggled, but Marz and Shears were there, watching my live stream, cheering me on and calling out cleaves (I know, I stood in the giant glowing mechanic, hard to believe huh?!). The energy was amazing when I finally got to phase 3 and cleaved down the shades and watched The Ashbringer fall! A moment I'm super glad to have shared with my warrior friends. And also to <b>Hayderz</b> who donated to me get the Mats for the Inquisitor enchant after I had spent all the gold I had on Ashbringer mats. This was the culmination of 20 years of my Warcraft experience and the quest for the sword.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
          All in all, Regret has made me feel like I have a family and home in the game and I wouldn't have it any other way. Thanks to everyone for making it great!
